# library-app
A web based library app that is meant to track the books you plan to read and the books you are currently reading. Currenly it supports local storage only, so all the data will be stored in your browser only. The app supports a responsive design so it will look equally well on different resolution sizes. 

Live Preview of the project is [here](https://iwantroca.github.io/library-app/).

### Notes
- I used JSON to store the data of books in the browser and later parse it back.
